# Pathfinding Visualization

So I'm yet again going through [Stephen Grider's Data Structures and Algorithm course](https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/) in an attempt to further solidify my knowledge of them. While I do truly grasp the concepts behind each one, and measuring algorithm performance and impact, I find that I often forget how to implement the algorithms themselves, I tend to stumble my way to a working solution for some of them, and blanking out for others.

I figured as I'm refreshing my memory on them, I'd put the knowledge to use and create a visualization of a couple of them like [Visualgo](https://visualgo.net/) that Stephen references (I highly HIGHLY recommend that site for those who are learning or need a refresher. It's because of that site I can stumble my way onto implementation from memory). Obviously my version won't be anywhere near as fully featured, nor will I be implementing data structures. This is but a small small project that'll take me some days to implement in between the other stuff I'm working on
